# Gemini API Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing `extractTextFromImage` Method
**Problem**: The code was trying to call `apiManager.services.gemini.extractTextFromImage(file)` but this method didn't exist in the `GeminiAPIService` class.

**Fix**: Added a complete `extractTextFromImage` method that:
- Converts images to base64 format
- Uses Gemini Vision API for text extraction
- Returns proper response format with success/error handling
- Includes confidence scoring and source identification

### 2. Outdated Model Name
**Problem**: The code was using `gemini-2.0-flash` which is experimental and has regional restrictions.

**Fix**: Updated all references to use `gemini-1.5-flash` which is more stable and widely available:
- Updated in `api-manager.js`
- Updated in `backend.js`
- Updated in all API calls

### 3. Poor Error Handling
**Problem**: Limited error handling and validation for API keys and responses.

**Fix**: Added comprehensive error handling:
- API key format validation (checks for proper Google API key format)
- Better error messages with specific details
- Graceful fallback handling
- Input validation before API calls

### 4. Missing Configuration File
**Problem**: No `config.js` file existed, causing the app to use fallback API keys.

**Fix**: Created `config.js` with proper structure and current API keys.

## Files Modified

1. **api-manager.js**
   - Added `extractTextFromImage` method to `GeminiAPIService`
   - Added `validateApiKey` method
   - Updated model name from `gemini-2.0-flash` to `gemini-1.5-flash`
   - Enhanced error handling in all methods
   - Added `fileToBase64` helper method

2. **backend.js**
   - Updated Gemini model name to `gemini-1.5-flash`

3. **config.js** (new file)
   - Created proper configuration file with API keys

4. **test-gemini.html** (new file)
   - Created test page to verify Gemini API functionality

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Update Your Gemini API Key
The current API key in the config might be a placeholder. To get a valid API key:

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
2. Sign in with your Google account
3. Create a new API key
4. Replace the `GEMINI_API_KEY` value in `config.js` with your new key

### 2. Test the Fix
1. Open `test-gemini.html` in your browser
2. The page will automatically test the connection
3. Test text analysis by clicking "Test Text Analysis"
4. Test image OCR by uploading an image and clicking "Test Image OCR"

### 3. Verify in Main Application
1. Open `index.html` in your browser
2. Try uploading an image with text
3. Check if OCR extraction works properly
4. Verify that fact-checking analysis runs on extracted text

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "Invalid Gemini API key format"
**Solution**: Make sure your API key:
- Starts with "AIza"
- Is exactly 39 characters long
- Doesn't contain placeholder text like "your_api_key_here"

### Issue: "Gemini API error: 403"
**Solution**: 
- Check if your API key is valid and active
- Ensure you have enabled the Generative Language API in Google Cloud Console
- Verify you haven't exceeded your quota

### Issue: "Model not found" or "404"
**Solution**: 
- The fix should resolve this by using `gemini-1.5-flash`
- If still occurring, check if the service is available in your region

### Issue: Image OCR not working
**Solution**:
- Ensure the image is in a supported format (JPEG, PNG, WebP)
- Check that the image file size is reasonable (< 10MB)
- Verify the image actually contains readable text

## Testing Results Expected

With a valid API key, you should see:
- ✅ Connection test passes
- ✅ Text analysis returns credibility scores and detailed analysis
- ✅ Image OCR extracts text from images with text content
- ✅ Main application can process images and analyze extracted text

## Additional Notes

- The fix uses `gemini-1.5-flash` which supports both text and vision capabilities
- Error handling is now more robust and provides clearer feedback
- The system will gracefully fall back to other OCR services if Gemini fails
- All changes maintain backward compatibility with existing functionality
